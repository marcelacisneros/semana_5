        used to work on the docks, union's been on strike
        He's down on his luck, it's tough, so tough
        <span style="color:#cc00cc; "><b>Gina</b></span>
        works the diner all day working for her man
        She brings home her pay, for love, for love
            <br><br>
              She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got
        It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot for love
        We'll give it a shot
            <br><br>
            Woah, we're half way there
        Woah, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
        Woah, livin' on a prayer
            <br><br>
            Tommy's got his six-string in hock
        Now he's holding in what he used to make it talk
        So tough, it's tough
        Gina dreams of running away
        When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
        Baby, it's okay, someday
            <br><br>
            We've got to hold on to what we've got
        It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
        We've got each other and that's a lot for love
        We'll give it a shot
            <br><br>
        Woah, we're half way there
        Woah, livin' on a prayer
        Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
        Woah, livin' on a prayer
        Livin' on a prayer
            <br><br>
        Oh, we've got to hold on, ready or not
        You live for the fight when it's all that you've got
        Woah, we're half way there
        Woah, livin' on a prayer
            <br><br>
        Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
